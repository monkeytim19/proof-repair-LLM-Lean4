For theorem CompleteLattice.independent_iff_supIndep_of_injOn in Mathlib/Order/CompactlyGenerated/Basic.lean:
lemma CompleteLattice.independent_iff_supIndep_of_injOn {ι : Type*} {f : ι → α}
    (hf : InjOn f {i | f i ≠ ⊥}) :
    CompleteLattice.Independent f ↔ ∀ (s : Finset ι), s.SupIndep f 


Original valid proof:

  refine ⟨fun h ↦ h.supIndep', fun h ↦ CompleteLattice.independent_def'.mpr fun i ↦ ?_⟩
  simp_rw [disjoint_iff, inf_sSup_eq_iSup_inf_sup_finset, iSup_eq_bot, ← disjoint_iff]
  intro s hs
  classical
  rw [← Finset.sup_erase_bot]
  set t := s.erase ⊥
  replace hf : InjOn f (f ⁻¹' t) := fun i hi j _ hij ↦ by
    refine hf ?_ ?_ hij <;> aesop (add norm simp [t])
  have : (Finset.erase (insert i (t.preimage _ hf)) i).image f = t := by
    ext a
    simp only [Finset.mem_preimage, Finset.mem_erase, ne_eq, Finset.mem_insert, true_or, not_true,
      Finset.erase_insert_eq_erase, not_and, Finset.mem_image, t]
    refine ⟨by aesop, fun ⟨ha, has⟩ ↦ ?_⟩
    obtain ⟨j, hj, rfl⟩ := hs has
    exact ⟨j, ⟨hj, ha, has⟩, rfl⟩
  rw [← this, Finset.sup_image]
  specialize h (insert i (t.preimage _ hf))
  rw [Finset.supIndep_iff_disjoint_erase] at h
  exact h i (Finset.mem_insert_self i _)

I'm not sure if this is a bug or not, but I'm not sure how to fix it.

####  Eric Wieser (Jun 01 2022 at 10:00):

I think the problem is that the proof ofFinset.supIndep_iff_disjoint_erase is not using the fact that the function is injective, and so the proof of the reverse direction is not using the fact that the function is injective.

####  Eric Wieser (Jun 01 2022 at 10:01):

I think the proof ofFinset.supIndep_iff_disjoint_erase should be
lemma Finset.supIndep_iff_disjoint_erase {s : Finset ι} {f : ι → α} :
  s.SupIndep f ↔ ∀ (i ∈ s) (j ∈ s.erase i), Disjoint (f i) (f j) :=

####  Eric Wieser (Jun 01 2022 at 10:02):

And the proof of the reverse direction should be
  refine ⟨fun h ↦ ⟨h.supIndep', fun i hi ↦ hf ?_⟩, fun h ↦ CompleteLattice.independent_def'.mpr fun i ↦ ?_⟩
  simp_rw [disjoint_iff, inf_sSup_eq_iSup_inf_sup_finset, iSup_eq_bot, ← disjoint_iff]
  intro s hs
  classical
  rw [← Finset.sup_erase_bot]
  set t := s.erase ⊥
  replace hf : InjOn f (f ⁻¹' t) := fun i hi j _ hij ↦ by refine hf ?_ ?_ hij <;> aesop
  have : (Finset.erase (insert i (t.preimage _ hf)) i).image f = t := by
    ext a
    simp only [Finset.mem_preimage, Finset.mem_erase, ne_eq, Finset.mem_insert, true_or, not_true,
      Finset.erase_insert_eq_erase, not_and, Finset.mem_image]
    refine ⟨by aesop, fun ⟨ha, has⟩ ↦ ?_⟩
    obtain ⟨j, hj, rfl⟩ := hs has
    exact ⟨j, ⟨hj, ha, has⟩, rfl⟩
