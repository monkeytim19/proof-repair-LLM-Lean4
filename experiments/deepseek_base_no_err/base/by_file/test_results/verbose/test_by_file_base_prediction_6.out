####  Johan Commelin (May 04 2020 at 10:00):

@Patrick Massot I think you're right.

####  Johan Commelin (May 04 2020 at 10:00):

I'm not sure what the best way to fix it is.

####  Johan Commelin (May 04 2020 at 10:01):

I think the problem is that we don't have a good way to get a map from a basic open to a general open.

####  Johan Commelin (May 04 2020 at 10:01):

I think we need a lemma that says that the basic open of a function in a general open is the same as the basic open of the restriction of that function to the general open.

####  Johan Commelin (May 04 2020 at 10:02):

And then we can use the fact that the basic open of a function in an affine open is zero.

I'm not sure if this is a good idea.

I think the problem is that you are using the wrong form of the induction hypothesis. The induction hypothesis is that the statement holds for all smaller values, not just the smaller values of the same type.
