For theorem norm_jacobiTheta₂_term_fderiv_le in Mathlib/NumberTheory/ModularForms/JacobiTheta/TwoVariable.lean:
lemma norm_jacobiTheta₂_term_fderiv_le (n : ℤ) (z τ : ℂ) :
    ‖jacobiTheta₂_term_fderiv n z τ‖ ≤ 3 * π * |n| ^ 2 * ‖jacobiTheta₂_term n z τ‖ 


Original valid proof:

  have hns (a : ℂ) (f : (ℂ × ℂ) →L[ℂ] ℂ) : ‖a • f‖ = ‖a‖ * ‖f‖ := norm_smul a f
  rw [jacobiTheta₂_term_fderiv, jacobiTheta₂_term, hns,
    mul_comm _ ‖cexp _‖, (by norm_num : (3 : ℝ) = 2 + 1), add_mul, add_mul]
  refine mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left ((norm_add_le _ _).trans (add_le_add ?_ ?_)) (norm_nonneg _)
  · simp_rw [hns, norm_mul, ← ofReal_ofNat, ← ofReal_intCast,
      norm_real, norm_of_nonneg zero_le_two, Real.norm_of_nonneg pi_pos.le, norm_I, mul_one,
      Real.norm_eq_abs, Int.cast_abs, mul_assoc]
    refine mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left (mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left ?_ pi_pos.le) two_pos.le
    refine le_trans ?_ (?_ : |(n : ℝ)| ≤ |(n : ℝ)| ^ 2)
    · exact mul_le_of_le_one_right (abs_nonneg _) (ContinuousLinearMap.norm_fst_le ..)
    · exact_mod_cast Int.le_self_sq |n|
  · simp_rw [hns, norm_mul, one_mul, norm_I, mul_one,
