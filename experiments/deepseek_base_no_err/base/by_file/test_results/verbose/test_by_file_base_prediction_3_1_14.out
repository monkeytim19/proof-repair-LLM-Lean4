---1/1---
For theorem Polynomial.natTrailingDegree_eq_of_trailingDegree_eq in Mathlib/Algebra/Polynomial/Degree/TrailingDegree.lean:
theorem natTrailingDegree_eq_of_trailingDegree_eq_some {p : R[X]} {n : ℕ}
    (h : trailingDegree p = n) : natTrailingDegree p = n 


Original valid proof:
:=
  have hp0 : p ≠ 0 := fun hp0 => by rw [hp0] at h; exact Option.noConfusion h
  Option.some_inj.1 <|
    show (natTrailingDegree p : ℕ∞) = n by rwa [← trailingDegree_eq_natTrailingDegree hp0]


Verifying proof (Commit bc769a9f781a01550bc7da7431e6157f3b3d6c81):
∨ p = 0 := by
  simp [natTrailingDegree, h]
