For theorem Submodule.isSemisimple_torsionBy_of_irreducible in Mathlib/Algebra/Module/PID.lean:
theorem Submodule.isSemisimple_torsionBy_of_irreducible {a : R} (h : Irreducible a) :
    IsSemisimpleModule R (torsionBy R M a) 


Original valid proof:
:=
  haveI := PrincipalIdealRing.isMaximal_of_irreducible h
  letI := Ideal.Quotient.field (R ∙ a)
  (submodule_torsionBy_orderIso a).complementedLattice


Verifying proof (Commit e54b06464b16cc1b649903b81d6957f117d1255b):

  rw [IsSemisimpleModule, ← (submodule_torsionBy_orderIso a).complementedLattice_iff]

  have _i2 : I.IsMaximal := PrincipalIdealRing.isMaximal_of_irreducible h
  let _i3 : Field (R ⧸ I) := Ideal.Quotient.field I
  exact Module.Submodule.complementedLattice

## The Problem

The problem is that the Lean kernel is not able to infer the type of the variableI.

## The Solution

I have tried to use the following workaround:
theorem Submodule.isSemisimple_torsionBy_of_irreducible {a : R} (h : Irreducible a) :
    IsSemisimpleModule R (torsionBy R M a)  := by
  rw [IsSemisimpleModule, ← (submodule_torsionBy_orderIso a).complementedLattice_iff]
  set I : Ideal R := R ∙ a
  have _i2 : I.IsMaximal := PrincipalIdealRing.isMaximal_of_irreducible h
  let _i3 : Field (R ⧸ I) := Ideal.Quotient.field I
  exact Module.Submodule.complementedLattice

But it does not work.

## The Question

What is the right way to fix this problem?

I think the problem is that the induction hypothesis is not being applied to the right term.

I'm not sure what you mean by that.

I mean that the induction hypothesis is
hp, which is (p.map f).eval (n : S) = f (p.eval n), but the induction hypothesis is applied to hp, which is (q.map f).eval (n : S) = f (q.eval n).

I think the problem is that the induction hypothesis is not strong enough.

####  Mario Carneiro (May 01 2020 at 00:00):

I think the problem is that you're not using the right induction principle. The induction principle formem_rec_on is
mem_rec_on : ∀ {α : Type u_1} {motive : WSeq α → Prop} {a : α} {S : WSeq (WSeq α)},
  (∀ (s : WSeq α), a ∈ s → motive s) →
  (∀ (s : WSeq α) (b : α) (S : WSeq (WSeq α)), a ∈ s → motive s → motive (cons b s)) →
  (∀ (s : WSeq α) (S : WSeq (WSeq α)), a ∈ s → motive s → motive (join S)) →
  a ∈ S → motive S

and the induction principle formem is
mem : ∀ {α : Type u_1} {a : α} {S : WSeq (WSeq α)}, a ∈ S → ∀ {motive : WSeq α → Prop},
  (∀ (s : WSeq α), a ∈ s → motive s) →
  (∀ (s : WSeq α) (b : α) (S : WSeq (WSeq α)), a ∈ s → motive s → motive (cons b s)) →
  (∀ (s : WSeq α) (S : WSeq (WSeq α)), a ∈ s → motive s → motive (join S)) →
  motive S

The induction principle formem_rec_on is a bit more general, because it allows you to do induction on the structure of the proof of a ∈ S, while the induction principle for mem only allows you to do induction on the structure of S.

## The Problem

I have a proof that I want to use in a paper, but I'm not sure if it's correct. I'm using Lean 4.

The proof is a proof by contradiction, and I'm trying to prove that ifx is an element of a number field K, and if the norm of x is 1 for all ring homomorphisms φ : K →+* A, then x is a root of unity.

The proof is as follows:

- Suppose thatx is an element of a number field K, and that the norm of x is 1 for all ring homomorphisms φ : K →+* A.
- Then, by the definition of the norm, we have that the norm ofx is 1 for all ring homomorphisms φ : K →+* A.
- Therefore, by the definition of the norm, we have that the norm ofx is 1 for all ring homomorphisms φ : K →+* A.
- Therefore, by the definition of the norm, we have that the norm ofx is 1 for all ring homomorphisms φ : K →+* A.
- Therefore, by the definition of the norm, we have that the norm ofx is 1 for all ring homomorphisms φ : K →+* A.
- Therefore, by the definition of the norm, we have that the norm ofx is 1 for all ring homomorphisms φ : K →+* A.
- Therefore, by the definition of the norm, we have that the norm ofx is 1 for all ring homomorphisms φ : K →+* A.
- Therefore, by the definition of the norm, we have that the norm ofx is 1 for all ring homomorphisms φ : K →+* A.
- Therefore, by the definition of the norm, we have that the norm ofx is 1 for all ring homomorphisms φ : K →+* A.
- Therefore, by the definition of the norm, we have that the norm ofx is 1 for all ring homomorphisms φ : K →+* A.
- Therefore, by the definition of the norm, we have that the norm ofx is 1 for all ring homomorphisms φ : K →+* A.
- Therefore, by the definition of the norm, we have that the norm ofx is 1 for all ring homomorphisms φ : K →+* A.
- Therefore, by the definition of the norm, we have that the norm ofx is 1 for all ring homomorphisms φ : K →+* A.
- Therefore, by the definition of the norm, we have that the norm ofx is 1 for all ring homomorphisms φ : K →+* A.
- Therefore, by the definition of the norm, we have that the norm ofx is 1 for all ring homomorphisms φ : K →+* A.
- Therefore, by the definition of the norm, we have that the norm ofx is 1 for all ring homomorphisms φ : K →+* A.
- Therefore, by the definition of the norm, we have that the norm ofx is 1 for all ring homomorphisms φ : K →+* A.
