I think the problem is that you're trying to use the fact that the order ofx is the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by x, but the order of the subgroup is the order of the generator, not the order of the generator's image.

I'm not sure if this is a bug or a feature, but Lean doesn't seem to be able to figure out that the order ofx is the order of the generator's image.

I've fixed the proof by using the fact that the order of the generator's image is the order of the subgroup, and then using the fact that the order of the subgroup is the order of the generator.

Here's the fixed proof:
