Working on Mathlib/GroupTheory/OrderOfElement.lean - 2024-09-08 12:19:37.872813.
---1/1---
For theorem IsOfFinOrder.apply in Mathlib/GroupTheory/OrderOfElement.lean:
theorem IsOfFinOrder.apply {η : Type*} {Gs : η → Type*} [∀ i, Monoid (Gs i)] {x : ∀ i, Gs i}
    (h : IsOfFinOrder x) : ∀ i, IsOfFinOrder (x i) 


Original valid proof:
:= by
  obtain ⟨n, npos, hn⟩ := h.exists_pow_eq_one
  exact fun _ => isOfFinOrder_iff_pow_eq_one.mpr ⟨n, npos, (congr_fun hn.symm _).symm⟩


Verifying proof (Commit ab56fa28da38a962b7952fc9e52edb14bef2bc5a):
 := by
  rcases(isOfFinOrder_iff_pow_eq_one _).mp h with ⟨n, npos, hn⟩
  exact fun _ => (isOfFinOrder_iff_pow_eq_one _).mpr ⟨n, npos, congr_fun hn.symm _⟩
