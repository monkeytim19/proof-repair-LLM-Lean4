For theorem Scott.IsOpen.isUpperSet in Mathlib/Topology/OmegaCompletePartialOrder.lean:
theorem IsOpen.isUpperSet {s : Set α} (hs : IsOpen α s) : IsUpperSet s 


Original valid proof:
:= hs.fst


Verifying proof (Commit 0c1dd9cbd45d804e559a743f61a0763f683221f0):
 :=
  IsOpen.monotone hs

####  Mario Carneiro (May 05 2020 at 05:00):

I think the problem is that the theorem is not stated correctly. The theorem should be
theorem IsOpen.isUpperSet {s : Set α} (hs : IsOpen α s) : IsUpperSet s :=
  IsOpen.monotone hs
