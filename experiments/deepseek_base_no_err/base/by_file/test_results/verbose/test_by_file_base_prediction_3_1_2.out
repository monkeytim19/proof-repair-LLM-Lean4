For theorem SetTheory.PGame.lf_iff_exists_le in Mathlib/SetTheory/Game/PGame.lean:
theorem lf_iff_exists_le {x y : PGame} :
    x ⧏ y ↔ (∃ i, x ≤ y.moveLeft i) ∨ ∃ j, x.moveRight j ≤ y 


Original valid proof:
:= by
  rw [LF, le_iff_forall_lf, not_and_or]
  simp


Verifying proof (Commit 69b7f4ab1136e43d2da107e18d8154c3019665d2):
∧ x ⧏ y.moveRight j := by
  rw [Lf, le_iff_forall_lf, not_and_or]
  simp

The problem is that the first proof is not valid, because the second disjunct of the right-hand side of the iff is not a disjunction, but a conjunction.
