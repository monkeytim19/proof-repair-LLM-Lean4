Hi,

I think the following is a better proof:
lemma inv {f : 𝕜 → 𝕜} {x : 𝕜} (hf : MeromorphicAt f x) : MeromorphicAt f⁻¹ x := by
  rcases hf with ⟨m, hf⟩
  by_cases h_eq : (fun z ↦ (z - x) ^ m • f z) =ᶠ[𝓝 x] 0
  · 
    refine (MeromorphicAt.const 0 x).congr ?_
    rw [eventuallyEq_nhdsWithin_iff]
    filter_upwards [h_eq] with z hfz hz
    rw [Pi.inv_apply, (smul_eq_zero_iff_right <| pow_ne_zero _ (sub_ne_zero.mpr hz)).mp hfz,
      inv_zero]
  · 
    obtain ⟨n, g, hg_an, hg_ne, hg_eq⟩ := hf.exists_eventuallyEq_pow_smul_nonzero_iff.mpr h_eq
    have : AnalyticAt 𝕜 (fun z ↦ (z - x) ^ (m + 1)) x :=
      ((analyticAt_id 𝕜 x).sub analyticAt_const).pow _
    refine ⟨n + 1, (this.smul <| hg_an.inv hg_ne).congr ?_⟩
    filter_upwards [hg_eq, hg_an.continuousAt.eventually_ne hg_ne] with z hfg hg_ne'

    · simp_rw [smul_eq_mul] at hfg ⊢
      have aux1 : f z ≠ 0

I think the problem is that you are using the wrong definition of analytic at.

The definition of analytic at is that the function is analytic in a neighborhood of the point.

The definition of analytic on a set is that the function is analytic in a neighborhood of every point in the set.

The definition of analytic at a point is that the function is analytic on a neighborhood of the point.

The definition of analytic on a set is that the function is analytic on the closure of the set.
