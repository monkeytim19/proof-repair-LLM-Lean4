## Comments

@Johan Commelin: I think the proof is correct now.

## Details

The problem was that the proof of the lemma
eqOn_zero_of_preconnected_of_eventuallyEq_zero_aux

was using the lemma
mem_closure_iff

which is not in mathlib.

I have a proof of the following theorem, but I am not sure if it is correct.

Theorem: Let $f$ be a function on $\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x) = f(x+1)$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$. Then $f$ is continuous if and only if it is uniformly continuous.

Proof:

Suppose $f$ is continuous. Let $\epsilon > 0$ be given. Since $f$ is continuous, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $|f(x) - f(y)| < \epsilon$ whenever $|x - y| < \delta$. Let $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$ be such that $|x - y| < \delta$. Then $|f(x) - f(y)| < \epsilon$. Since $f(x) = f(x+1)$, we have $|f(x) - f(y+1)| < \epsilon$. Since $f(y) = f(y+1)$, we have $|f(x) - f(y)| < \epsilon$. Therefore, $f$ is uniformly continuous.

Suppose $f$ is uniformly continuous. Let $\epsilon > 0$ be given. Since $f$ is uniformly continuous, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $|f(x) - f(y)| < \epsilon$ whenever $|x - y| < \delta$. Let $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$ be such that $|x - y| < \delta$. Then $|f(x) - f(y)| < \epsilon$. Since $f(x) = f(x+1)$, we have $|f(x) - f(y+1)| < \epsilon$. Since $f(y) = f(y+1)$, we have $|f(x) - f(y)| < \epsilon$. Therefore, $f$ is continuous.

Proof:

Suppose $f$ is continuous. Let $\epsilon > 0$ be given. Since $f$ is continuous, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $|f(x) - f(y)| < \epsilon$ whenever $|x - y| < \delta$. Let $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$ be such that $|x - y| < \delta$. Then $|f(x) - f(y)| < \epsilon$. Since $f(x) = f(x+1)$, we have $|f(x) - f(y+1)| < \epsilon$. Since $f(y) = f(y+1)$, we have $|f(x) - f(y)| < \epsilon$. Therefore, $f$ is uniformly continuous.

Theorem: Let $f$ be a function on $\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x) = f(x+1)$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$. Then $f$ is continuous if and only if it is uniformly continuous.

# Hahn-Banach theorem

This file contains a proof of the Hahn-Banach theorem on extending bounded linear maps between
real normed spaces.

## Main statements

* `exists_extension_of_bounded_linear_map` :
  Hahn-Banach theorem. Provides a linear map `f'` such that
  `∀ x ∈ s, f' x = f x` and `∥f'∥ = ∥f∥` whenever `f` is a bounded linear map
  defined on a subspace of a real normed space `E` and `s` is a subspace of `E`
  that contains the domain of `f`.

## TODO

* Extend to complex vector spaces.
* Extend to F-spaces.
* Extend to `Λ`-spaces.
* Extend to topological vector spaces.
* Extend to `Λ`-spaces.

/-- **Hahn-Banach theorem**:
If `f` is a linear map into `ℝ` and `p` is a submodule of `E`
such that `f` is bounded when restricted to `p`,
then `f` can be extended to a linear map `f'` such that
`∥f'∥ = ∥f∥` and `f'` is bounded when restricted to `p`.

The problem is that the functionz * Gamma z is not continuous at 0, so you can't use the continuity of the composition.

## 1 answer

I think the problem is that you are using the wrong induction hypothesis.

The induction hypothesis should be that the theorem holds for all lists of lengthlen, not just for lists of length len + 1.

So, you should have:
theorem map_enumFrom_eq_zipWith : ∀ (l : List α) (n : ℕ) (f : ℕ → α → β),
    map (uncurry f) (enumFrom n l) = zipWith (fun i ↦ f (i + n)) (range (length l)) l  := by
  intro l
  generalize e : l.length = len
  revert l
  induction' len with len ih <;> intros l e n f
  · have : l = [] := by
      cases l
      · rfl
      · contradiction
    rw [this]; rfl
  · cases' l with head tail
    · contradiction
    · simp only [map, uncurry_apply_pair, range_succ_eq_map, zipWith, zero_add, zipWith_map_left]
      rw [ih]
      · suffices (fun i ↦ f (i + (n + 1))) = ((fun i ↦ f (i + n)) ∘ Nat.succ) by
          rw [this]
          rfl
        funext n' a
        simp only [comp, Nat.add_assoc, Nat.add_comm, Nat.add_succ]

For theorem IsIntegralCurve.isIntegralCurveAt in Mathlib/Geometry/Manifold/IntegralCurve.lean:
lemma IsIntegralCurve.isIntegralCurveAt (h : IsIntegralCurve γ v) (t : ℝ) :
    IsIntegralCurveAt γ v t 


Original valid proof:
:= isIntegralCurveAt_iff.mpr ⟨univ, Filter.univ_mem, fun t _ ↦ h t⟩


Verifying proof (Commit 2c4d77d7fd709133772709da9ffb1d698ecbcd0a):
 :=
  let ⟨n, hn, h⟩ := h t
  ⟨n, hn, fun t _ => h t⟩

The original proof is incorrect because it assumes that the functionh is defined for all t, which is not necessarily the case. The repaired proof uses the let-expression to extract the values of n, hn, and h from the hypothesis h, and then uses them to construct the proof of IsIntegralCurveAt γ v t.

## Proof of the theorem

The proof of the theorem is by contradiction. We assume that there are only finitely many Fermat pseudoprimes to base $b$, and then we find a larger Fermat pseudoprime to base $b$ that is not in the finite set, which is a contradiction.

We first define the set of Fermat pseudoprimes to base $b$ that are less than or equal to $n$.

We then use the fact that there are only finitely many Fermat pseudoprimes to base $b$ to show that this set is finite.

We then use the fact that there are infinitely many primes to show that there are infinitely many Fermat pseudoprimes to base $b$ that are not in the set.

We then use the fact that there are infinitely many Fermat pseudoprimes to base $b$ that are not in the set to show that there are infinitely many Fermat pseudoprimes to base $b$.

We then use the fact that there are infinitely many Fermat pseudoprimes to base $b$ to show that there are infinitely many Fermat pseudoprimes to base $b$ that are not in the set.

The problem is that you're using the wrong definition ofgeom_sum_mul.

The definition inmathlib is
lemma geom_sum_mul {R : Type*} [comm_ring R] (x : R) (n : ℕ) :
  geom_sum x n * (1 - x) = 1 - x ^ n :=

which is the correct one.

The definition in your code is
lemma geom_sum_mul {R : Type*} [comm_ring R] (x : R) (n : ℕ) :
  (1 - x) * geom_sum x n = 1 - x ^ n :=

which is the wrong one.

I think the problem is that you're trying to prove a statement about all cardinals, but the proof is only valid for cardinals above aleph_0.

You can't prove a statement about all cardinals, because you can't prove it for 0
