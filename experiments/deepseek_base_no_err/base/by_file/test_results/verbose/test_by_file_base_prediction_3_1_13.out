For theorem Nat.pow_le_iff_le_log in Mathlib/Data/Nat/Log.lean:
theorem pow_le_iff_le_log {b : ℕ} (hb : 1 < b) {x y : ℕ} (hy : y ≠ 0) :
    b ^ x ≤ y ↔ x ≤ log b y 


Original valid proof:
:= by
  induction' y using Nat.strong_induction_on with y ih generalizing x
  cases x with
  | zero => dsimp; omega
  | succ x =>
    rw [log]; split_ifs with h
    · have b_pos : 0 < b := lt_of_succ_lt hb
      rw [Nat.add_le_add_iff_right, ← ih (y / b) (div_lt_self
        (Nat.pos_iff_ne_zero.2 hy) hb) (Nat.div_pos h.1 b_pos).ne', le_div_iff_mul_le b_pos,
        pow_succ', Nat.mul_comm]
    · exact iff_of_false (fun hby => h ⟨(le_self_pow x.succ_ne_zero _).trans hby, hb⟩)
        (not_succ_le_zero _)


Verifying proof (Commit 41b955aad45c24b4e2c9b0cae45d9ea397306cf5):
 := by
  induction' y using Nat.strong_induction_on with y ih generalizing x
  cases x with
  | zero => exact iff_of_true hy.bot_lt (zero_le _)
  | succ x =>
    rw [log]; split_ifs with h
    · have b_pos : 0 < b := zero_le_one.trans_lt hb
      rw [add_le_add_iff_right, ←
        ih (y / b) (div_lt_self hy.bot_lt hb) (Nat.div_pos h.1 b_pos).ne', le_div_iff_mul_le b_pos,
        pow_succ', mul_comm]
    · exact iff_of_false (fun hby => h ⟨(le_self_pow x.succ_ne_zero _).trans hby, hb⟩)
        (not_succ_le_zero _)

I'm not sure if this is a bug or not, but I'm not sure how to fix it.

I think the problem is that the proof of the induction step is not well-formed. The induction hypothesis is not applied to the correct term.
