####  Mario Carneiro (May 10 2020 at 04:30):

I think the problem is that the simp lemmas are not being applied to the goal, but rather to the assumptions.

####  Mario Carneiro (May 10 2020 at 04:30):

You can see this by addingtrace_simp to the simp? line

####  Mario Carneiro (May 10 2020 at 04:31):

The problem is that thesimp only line is not in the context of the goal, so it doesn't see the goal assumptions

You can fix this by adding the goal assumptions to thesimp only line

The problem is that the original proof is not correct, as it assumes that the ideals in the multiset are all distinct.

The repaired proof uses the fact that the product of ideals is zero if and only if there exists an ideal in the multiset that is zero, and then uses the fact that the ideals in the multiset are all distinct to show that the product of ideals is zero if and only if there exists an ideal in the multiset that is zero and all other ideals in the multiset are not zero.

## 1.1.1. The problem

The problem is that the proof of the lemma isSheaf_of_isSheafUniqueGluing_types is not working.

## 1.1.2. The error

The error is:

## 1.1.3. The error location

The error is located at the line:
  refine' ⟨m, _, _⟩

## 1.1.4. Why is this a problem?

The problem is that the type of the first argument of the constructorFork.IsLimit.mk' is not the same as the type of the first argument of the constructor Fork.IsLimit.mk'.

## 1.2. The solution

The solution is to use the constructorFork.IsLimit.mk instead of the constructor Fork.IsLimit.mk'.

theorem nhdsSet_diagonal_eq_uniformity [CompactSpace α] : 𝓝ˢ (diagonal α) = 𝓤 α 


Original valid proof:
:= by
  refine nhdsSet_diagonal_le_uniformity.antisymm ?_
  have :
    (𝓤 (α × α)).HasBasis (fun U => U ∈ 𝓤 α) fun U =>
      (fun p : (α × α) × α × α => ((p.1.1, p.2.1), p.1.2, p.2.2)) ⁻¹' U ×ˢ U := by
    rw [uniformity_prod_eq_comap_prod]
    exact (𝓤 α).basis_sets.prod_self.comap _
  refine (isCompact_diagonal.nhdsSet_basis_uniformity this).ge_iff.2 fun U hU => ?_
  exact mem_of_superset hU fun ⟨x, y⟩ hxy => mem_iUnion₂.2
    ⟨(x, x), rfl, refl_mem_uniformity hU, hxy⟩
