####  Mario Carneiro (May 01 2020 at 00:02):

I think the problem is that the goal is{B | M✶.Base B} = (fun X ↦ M.E \ X) '' {B | M.Base B} and the tactic is trying to prove it by rewriting the left hand side to {B | M.Base B} and then applying the image_eq_iff_of_subset_range lemma, which requires the range of the function to be a subset of the codomain.

####  Mario Carneiro (May 01 2020 at 00:03):

The problem is that the range ofM.E \ X is not a subset of the codomain, because the codomain is {B | M.Base B} and the range is {B | M.Base (M.E \ B)}

####  Mario Carneiro (May 01 2020 at 00:04):

The solution is to use the fact thatM.E \ (M.E \ B) = B, which is the reason for the diff_diff_cancel_left lemma

I think the problem is that you're not using the induction hypothesis correctly. The induction hypothesis is thata ∈ s ++ join S → a ∈ s ∨ ∃ s, s ∈ S ∧ a ∈ s, but you're only using it in the case where a ∈ s.

Best answer

I'm not sure if this is the best way to fix the proof, but I think the following is a more direct way to fix the proof.

The proof is broken because the following line:
calc
  ∑ g : G, f g = ∑ g : G, (f.toHomUnits g : R) := rfl

is not valid. The type of the left-hand side isR, and the type of the right-hand side is Rˣ.

The following is a valid proof:
theorem sum_hom_units_eq_zero (f : G →* R) (hf : f ≠ 1) : ∑ g : G, f g = 0 := by
  classical
    obtain ⟨x, hx⟩ :
