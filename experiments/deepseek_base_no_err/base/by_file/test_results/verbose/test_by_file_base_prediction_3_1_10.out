For theorem List.exists_tfae in Mathlib/Data/List/TFAE.lean:
theorem exists_tfae {α : Type*} (l : List (α → Prop)) (H : ∀ a : α, (l.map (fun p ↦ p a)).TFAE) :
    (l.map (fun p ↦ ∃ a, p a)).TFAE 


Original valid proof:
:= by
  simp only [TFAE, List.forall_mem_map_iff]
  intros p₁ hp₁ p₂ hp₂
  exact exists_congr fun a ↦ H a (p₁ a) (mem_map_of_mem (fun p ↦ p a) hp₁)
    (p₂ a) (mem_map_of_mem (fun p ↦ p a) hp₂)


Verifying proof (Commit c932badd26769438b46c1ea96eb6e2d1fd7e0896):
 := by
  simp_rw [TFAE, List.forall_mem_map_iff]
  intros p₁ hp₁ p₂ hp₂
  exact exists_congr fun a ↦ H a (p₁ a) (mem_map_of_mem (fun p ↦ p a) hp₁)
    (p₂ a) (mem_map_of_mem (fun p ↦ p a) hp₂)
