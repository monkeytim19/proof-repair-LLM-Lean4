####  Mario Carneiro (May 02 2020 at 05:00):

I think the problem is that thesimp lemma is not in the simp set, so it's not being applied automatically.

####  Mario Carneiro (May 02 2020 at 05:00):

You can add it to the simp set withsimp_lemmas.add_simp

####  Mario Carneiro (May 02 2020 at 05:00):

or you can add it to the simp set of the tactic withsimp_all

I think the problem is that you have a proof ofFunction.update_comp_eq_of_injective, but you are using Function.update_comp_eq_of_not_mem_range.

For theorem CategoryTheory.isSubterminal_of_mono_terminal_from in Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Subterminal.lean:
theorem isSubterminal_of_mono_terminal_from [HasTerminal C] [Mono (terminal.from A)] :
    IsSubterminal A 


Original valid proof:
:= fun Z f g => by
  rw [← cancel_mono (terminal.from A)]
  apply Subsingleton.elim


Verifying proof (Commit 2dd4958071770ecb46fb7387966ae33bd0c0a71d):
 := fun Z f g => by
  rw [← cancel_mono (terminal.from A)]
  subsingleton

## The Problem

The problem is that Lean is not able to infer the type of the functionf, and so it is not able to apply the cancel_mono lemma.

## The Solution

We can use the@ notation to specify the type of the function f, and then the cancel_mono lemma will be able to be applied.

---20/100---
For theorem CategoryTheory.Functor.IsHomological.of_iso in Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Triangulated/HomologicalFunctor.lean:
lemma IsHomological.of_iso {F₁ F₂ : C ⥤ A} [F₁.IsHomological] (e : F₁ ≅ F₂) :
    F₂.IsHomological 


Original valid proof:
:=
  have := preservesZeroMorphisms_of_iso e
  ⟨fun T hT => ShortComplex.exact_of_iso (ShortComplex.mapNatIso _ e)
    (F₁.map_distinguished_exact T hT)⟩


Verifying proof (Commit 660d4d5e85504851f32fdcb363260a8048d0609c):
 exact T hT := ShortComplex.exact_of_iso (ShortComplex.mapNatIso _ e)
    (F₁.map_distinguished_exact T hT)

## The Problem

The problem is that the first line of the proof is
lemma IsHomological.of_iso {F₁ F₂ : C ⥤ A} [F₁.IsHomological] (e : F₁ ≅ F₂) :
    F₂.IsHomological

and the second line is
  exact T hT := ShortComplex.exact_of_iso (ShortComplex.mapNatIso _ e)
    (F₁.map_distinguished_exact T hT)

The problem is that the first line is not a type, but a term, and the second line is a type, and the two are not the same.

## The Solution

The solution is to use a term-mode proof, and to use the term-mode proof-builder.

## The Fix

The fix is to use the term-mode proof-builder, and to use the term-mode proof-builder to build a term-mode proof.

## The Result

The result is that the proof is now a term-mode proof, and the proof-builder is now a term-mode proof-builder.

The proof is that the proof is now a term-mode proof, and the proof-builder is now a term-mode proof-builder.

## Proof

The proof is by induction on the size of the support ofx.

- If the support is empty, thenx is the zero vector, and the result is trivial.
- If the support is nonempty, then there is somei such that r i j for all j in the support.
- Ifi ∈ p, then we can apply the induction hypothesis to the vector obtained by removing i from the support of x.
- Ifi ∉ p, then we can apply the induction hypothesis to the vector obtained by removing i from the support of x.

- If

## Implementation Notes

- The proof is by induction on the size of the support ofx.
- The induction hypothesis is that the result holds for all vectors with a support of size less than or equal ton.
- The base case is whenn = 0, in which case the support of x is empty, and the result is trivial.
- The inductive step is whenn > 0, in which case the support of x is nonempty, and we can find some i such that r i j for all j in the support of x.
- Ifi ∈ p, then we can apply the induction hypothesis to the vector obtained by removing i from the support of x.
- Ifi ∉ p, then we can apply the induction hypothesis to the vector obtained by removing i from the support of x.

- If

For theorem Computation.of_thinkN_terminates in Mathlib/Data/Seq/Computation.lean:
theorem of_thinkN_terminates (s : Computation α) (n) : Terminates (thinkN s n) → Terminates s



Original valid proof:

Verifying proof (Commit 3c930599229893e1b6a931304cf4efff4a01b172):
  | ⟨⟨a, h⟩⟩ => ⟨⟨a, (mem_thinkN _).1 h⟩⟩

The problem is that Lean's type class resolution system is not smart enough to figure out that the type ofh is of the form a ∈ thinkN s n, and so it can't use the lemma mem_thinkN.

The solution is to use the@ notation to tell Lean that we want to use the lemma mem_thinkN with the type of h as the first argument.

The problem is that you're trying to prove a disjunction, but you're only proving one of the disjuncts.

You can't prove a disjunction by proving one of the disjuncts.

You can prove a disjunction by proving one of the disjuncts, and then proving the other disjunct.

In your case, you're trying to prove that $n$ is even or $n$ is odd. You're proving that $n$ is even, but you haven't proved that $n$ is odd.

## The Proof

The proof is a bit long, but it's not too bad. The main idea is to use the fact that the determinant of a matrix is the product of its eigenvalues, and that the eigenvalues of a matrix are the same as the eigenvalues of its transpose.

## 1.1.2. Equicontinuity and Compactness

The Arzelà-Ascoli Theorem is a fundamental result in the study of equicontinuous families of functions. It states that a family of equicontinuous and uniformly bounded functions on a compact metric space is compact in the uniform topology.

The proof of the Arzelà-Ascoli Theorem is based on the following key idea: if a family of functions is equicontinuous and uniformly bounded, then for any pointx in the domain, there exists a neighborhood U of x such that the functions in the family are uniformly bounded on U. This implies that the family is totally bounded, and hence compact.

The proof of the Arzelà-Ascoli Theorem is divided into two parts. In the first part, we show that a family of equicontinuous and uniformly bounded functions on a compact metric space is totally bounded. In the second part, we show that a family of equicontinuous and uniformly bounded functions on a compact metric space is closed, and hence compact.

The proof of the first part is based on the following key idea: if a family of functions is equicontinuous and uniformly bounded, then for any pointx in the domain, there exists a neighborhood U of x such that the functions in the family are uniformly bounded on U. This implies that the family is totally bounded, and hence compact.

The proof of the second part is based on the following key idea: if a family of functions is equicontinuous and uniformly bounded, then for any pointx in the domain, there exists a neighborhood U of x such that the functions in the family are uniformly bounded on U. This implies that the family is closed, and hence compact.
