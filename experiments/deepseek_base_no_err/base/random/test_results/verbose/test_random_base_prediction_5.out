Hi,

I think the problem is that you are using the fact that the composition of analytic functions is analytic, which is not true in general.

You can use the fact that the composition of meromorphic functions is meromorphic, which is true in general.

I think you can prove it by using the fact that the composition of meromorphic functions is meromorphic, and then use the fact that the composition of analytic functions is analytic.

I hope this helps!

Best regards,

Alex

I'm not sure what the problem is, but the proof is a lot shorter with the following:

I'm not sure if this is the best way to fix this, but I think it's a good start.

I think the problem is that the proof ofGammaSeq_mul is not using the fact that GammaSeq_tendsto_Gamma is a limit, but just a sequence.

I think the problem is that you're using the wrong instance.

You're using the instance that the colimit of a functor is a colimit cocone.

But you're trying to prove that the colimit of a functor is a colimit cocone.

You need to use the instance that the colimit of a functor is a colimit cocone, and then the instance that a colimit cocone is a colimit.

## The problem

The problem is that the first line of the proof is
have : map f g = (map f (AlgHom.id R D)).comp (map (AlgHom.id R A) g) := ext rfl rfl

which is a bit of a mess.

## The solution

The solution is to use theext tactic, which is a bit more powerful than the rw tactic.

Haar measure, locally compact group

### The Haar measure on a locally compact group #

We construct the Haar measure on a locally compact group, and show that it is unique up to a scalar. This measure is defined by mapping a Borel set $S$ to the measure of the set of all translates of $S$ that contain a fixed open neighborhood of the identity. We then show that it is left-invariant, and if the group is σ-compact, it is the unique left-invariant measure.

We also define the notion of a measure on a topological additive group that is left invariant with respect to group translations.

I have a proof of the following theorem, but I am not sure if it is correct.

Theorem: Let $X$ be a topological space. Then $X$ is a Lindelof space if and only if for every open cover $\mathcal{U}$ of $X$, there exists a countable subcover of $\mathcal{U}$.

Proof:

$\Rightarrow$ Suppose $X$ is a Lindelof space. Let $\mathcal{U}$ be an open cover of $X$. Then $\mathcal{U}$ is an open cover of $X$ and $\mathcal{U}$ is a collection of open sets. Since $X$ is a Lindelof space, there exists a countable subcover of $\mathcal{U}$.

$\Leftarrow$ Suppose for every open cover $\mathcal{U}$ of $X$, there exists a countable subcover of $\mathcal{U}$. Let $\mathcal{V}$ be an open cover of $X$. Then $\mathcal{V}$ is an open cover of $X$ and $\mathcal{V}$ is a collection of open sets. Since for every open cover $\mathcal{U}$ of $X$, there exists a countable subcover of $\mathcal{U}$, there exists a countable subcover of $\mathcal{V}$. Therefore, $X$ is a Lindelof space.

Verifying proof (Commit 5192777c94aec06289e492ce206d68fbbe72572c):

The problem is that Lean doesn't know thatUᶜ is nonempty, and it's not clear how to prove it.

For theorem ball_inter_left in Mathlib/Topology/UniformSpace/Basic.lean:
theorem ball_inter_left (x : β) (V W : Set (β × β)) : ball x (V ∩ W) ⊆ ball x V 


Original valid proof:

####  Kevin Buzzard (May 05 2020 at 10:02):

I think the problem is that the goal isball x (V ∩ W) ⊆ ball x V and the theorem is ball_mono (inter_subset_left V W) x. The theorem is not a subset inclusion, it's a subset of a subset.
