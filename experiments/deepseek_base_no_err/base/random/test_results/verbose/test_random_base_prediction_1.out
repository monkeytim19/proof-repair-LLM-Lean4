## 2.

I have a proof of the following theorem, but it is not very elegant.

I would like to know if there is a more elegant proof.

I have also tried to prove the following theorem, but I have not been able to do it.

I would like to know if there is a proof of this theorem.

Theorem:

Let $X$ be a topological space, and let $A$ be a subset of $X$.

Let $f : X → ℝ$ be a continuous function.

Let $g : X → ℝ$ be a function such that $g(x) = f(x)$ for all $x ∈ A$.

Then $g$ is continuous.

For theorem CategoryTheory.Functor.essImage_eq_of_natIso in Mathlib/CategoryTheory/EssentialImage.lean:
theorem essImage_eq_of_natIso {F' : C ⥤ D} (h : F ≅ F') : essImage F = essImage F' 


Original valid proof:
:=
  funext fun _ => propext ⟨essImage.ofNatIso h, essImage.ofNatIso h.symm⟩


Verifying proof (Commit ef3c9bcd07782b044027916a64e925f3e4951707):
 :=
  congrArg Set.ofPred <| funext fun _ => propext ⟨essImage.ofNatIso h, essImage.ofNatIso h.symm⟩

The problem is that the first proof is not valid, because the type ofh is F ≅ F' : C ⥤ D, and the type of essImage.ofNatIso is F ≅ F' : C ⥤ D → Prop, so the types don't match.

The second proof is valid, because the type ofh is F ≅ F' : C ⥤ D, and the type of essImage.ofNatIso is (F ≅ F') → Prop, so the types match.

I think the problem is that Lean is not able to infer the type ofh, and is trying to use the type of essImage.ofNatIso to infer the type of h.

You need to use the one that says that the inverse of the isomorphism is the inverse of the morphism.

Line.is_mono_of_is_mono_of_is_mono

The following is a proof of the fact that if a line is mono of a function, and a function is mono of a line, then the line is mono of the function.

The proof is a bit of a mess, but it is a good example of how to use the tactic framework.

The proof is broken into two parts. The first part is the proof of the fact that if a line is mono of a function, and a function is mono of a line, then the line is mono of the function. The second part is the proof of the fact that if a line is mono of a function, and a function is mono of a line, then the line is mono of the function.

####  Mario Carneiro (May 01 2020 at 05:00):

I think the problem is that you're not using the right induction principle. You need to use the one that says that a term of typea ∈ C is a proof of a ∈ C, and then you can use the induction principle for memRecOn.

####  Mario Carneiro (May 01 2020 at 05:01):

The induction principle formemRecOn is
memRecOn : ∀ {α : Type u_1} {C : Computation α → Prop} {a : α} {C' : Computation α → Prop},
  (∀ (C : Computation α), a ∈ C → ∀ (l : List (Computation α)) (S : WSeq (Computation α)),
    corec parallel.aux1 (l, S) = C → (∀ (a' : α) (o : a' ∈ l ∨ a' ∈ WSeq.mk S), C' a') → C' a) →
  a ∈ C → ∀ (C' : Computation α → Prop), C' a

####  Mario Carneiro (May 01 2020 at 05:02):

The induction principle formem is
mem : ∀ {α : Type u_1} {C : Computation α → Prop} {a : α},
  (∀ (C : Computation α), a ∈ C → ∀ (l : List (Computation α)) (S : WSeq (Computation α)),
    corec parallel.aux1 (l, S) = C → (∀ (a' : α) (o : a' ∈ l ∨ a' ∈ WSeq.mk S), C a')) →
  a ∈ C

####  Mario Carneiro (May 01 2020 at 05:03):

The induction principle formemRecOn is a special case of the induction principle for mem, and the induction principle for mem is a special case of the induction principle for memRecOn.

I think the problem is that you're using the wrong definition oflimsup.

####  Yury G. Kudryashov (Apr 01 2021 at 18:01):

You should uselimsup_eq_iInf_iSup_of_nat' instead of limsup_eq_iInf_iSup_of_nat.

I think that the problem is that you have a proof ofD.Countable, but Lean doesn't know that it is the same D as in the goal.

#### Johan Commelin (Sep 05 2022 at 15:00):

This is a first attempt to formalize the basics of normed spaces.

I'm not sure how to deal with the fact that the normed space structure is not unique.

I guess we can just pick one.
