I think the problem is that the induction hypothesis is not strong enough.

####  Mario Carneiro (May 01 2020 at 07:00):

I think the problem is that the induction hypothesis is not strong enough.

I don't think so. The induction hypothesis is thatcos θ = Real.cos ψ ↔ θ = ψ ∨ θ = -ψ, and the goal is to prove the same thing for cos (θ + π). The induction hypothesis is strong enough to prove the goal.

####  Mario Carneiro (May 01 2020 at 07:01):

The problem is that the goal is notcos (θ + π) = Real.cos ψ ↔ θ + π = ψ ∨ θ + π = -ψ, but cos (θ + π) = Real.cos ψ ↔ θ + π = ψ ∨ θ + π = -ψ ∨ θ + π = ψ + π ∨ θ + π = -ψ + π

## The problem

The problem is that the first line of the proof is not well-typed.

## The solution

I think the problem is that Lean is not able to infer the type of the variableZ.

## The question

How can I fix this?

## Minimal example

Here is a minimal example:
import algebra.homology.homological_complex

open category_theory

variable (Z : ℕ → Type)

I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask, but I'm not sure how to ask this question.

I'm trying to prove that the following diagram commutes:

I've tried to prove it using the following code:
theorem expComparison_whiskerLeft {A A' : C} (f : A' ⟶ A) :

  unfold expComparison pre
  have vcomp1 := MatesConjugates_vcomp
    (exp.adjunction A) (exp.adjunction (F.obj A)) (exp.adjunction (F.obj A'))
    ((prodComparisonNatIso F A).inv) ((prod.functor.map (F.map f)))
  have vcomp2 := ConjugatesMates_vcomp
    (exp.adjunction A) (exp.adjunction A') (exp.adjunction (F.obj A'))

  have piso := (prodComparison_inv_natural F f (𝟙 B)).symm

But I get the following error:

but is expected to have type

I'm not sure how to fix this.

The error message is correct. The proof is not correct.

For theorem IsIntegralCurve.isIntegralCurveAt in Mathlib/Geometry/Manifold/IntegralCurve.lean:
lemma IsIntegralCurve.isIntegralCurveAt (h : IsIntegralCurve γ v) (t : ℝ) :
    IsIntegralCurveAt γ v t 


Original valid proof:
:= isIntegralCurveAt_iff.mpr ⟨univ, Filter.univ_mem, fun t _ ↦ h t⟩


Verifying proof (Commit 2c4d77d7fd709133772709da9ffb1d698ecbcd0a):
 :=
  let ⟨n, hn, h⟩ := h t
  ⟨n, hn, fun t _ => h t⟩

The original proof is incorrect because it assumes that the functionh is defined for all t, which is not necessarily the case. The repaired proof uses the let-expression to extract the values of n, hn, and h from the hypothesis h, and then uses them to construct the proof of IsIntegralCurveAt γ v t.

## Proofs

### Proof of the theorem

The proof of the theorem is by induction onn.

- Base case:n = 0.

In this case, the theorem reduces toSemiconj f^[0] (g k) (g <| 0 + k), which is true by id_left.

- Inductive step:n = m + 1.

In this case, the theorem reduces toSemiconj f^[m + 1] (g k) (g <| (m + 1) + k).

By the inductive hypothesis, we haveSemiconj f^[m] (g k) (g <| m + k).

By the definition ofSemiconj, we have Semiconj f (g <| m + k) (g <| (m + 1) + k).

By the transitivity ofSemiconj, we have Semiconj f^[m + 1] (g k) (g <| (m + 1) + k).

This completes the proof of the inductive step.

### Proof of the lemma

The proof of the lemma is by induction onn.

- Base case:n = 0.

In this case, the lemma reduces toSemiconj f^[0] (g 0) (g <| 0 + 0), which is true by id_left.

- Inductive step:n = m + 1.

In this case, the lemma reduces toSemiconj f^[m + 1] (g 0) (g <| (m + 1) + 0).

By the inductive hypothesis, we haveSemiconj f^[m] (g 0) (g <| m + 0).

By the definition ofSemiconj, we have Semiconj f (g <| m + 0) (g <| (m + 1) + 0).

By the transitivity ofSemiconj, we have Semiconj f^[m + 1] (g 0) (g <| (m + 1) + 0).

This completes the proof of the inductive step.

In this case, the lemma reduces toSemiconj f^[m + 1] (g 0) (g <| (m + 1) + 0).

By the inductive hypothesis, we haveSemiconj f^[m] (g 0) (g <| m + 0).

By the definition ofSemiconj, we have Semiconj f (g <| m + 0) (g <| (m + 1) + 0).

By the transitivity ofSemiconj, we have Semiconj f^[m + 1] (g 0) (g <| (m + 1

### Uniform integrability #

A sequence of functions is uniformly integrable if it is uniformly bounded inL(p,μ) and
the Lp.cofinite part of the sequence is uniformly absolutely continuous.

### Vitali convergence theorem #

The Vitali convergence theorem: if a sequence of functions is uniformly integrable, and it is uniformly integrable, then the limit of the L(p,μ) part of the sequence is the L(p,μ) part of the limit.

I think that the original proof is correct.

The problem is that the trimmed measure is not a complete measure.

So, the trimmed version of the set{x | f x ≤ g x} is not measurable.

I think the problem is that you have a proof of∀ i ∈ t, MeasurableSet (s i) and a proof of ∀ i ∈ t, IntegrableOn f (s i) μ, but you need a proof of ∀ i ∈ t, MeasurableSet (s i) ∧ IntegrableOn f (s i) μ.
